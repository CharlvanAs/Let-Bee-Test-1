                        <h3>Our Obligations</h3>
                        <p>We may use your personal data to fulfil our obligations to you.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Messages and Updates</h3>
                        <p>We may send administrative messages and email updates to you about the website or the application. We may wish to provide you with information about new goods or services in which we think you may be interested. This means that in some cases, we may also send you primarily promotional messages. We will not send you promotional messages unless you have chosen to opt-into them. But, we may send you one message asking you to opt-into promotional messages without you having opted-into promotional messages.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Targeted Content</h3>
                        <p>While you are logged into the website or application, we may display targeted adverts and other relevant information based on your personal data. In a completely automated process, computers process the personal data and match it to adverts or related information. We never share personal data with any advertiser unless you specifically provide us with your consent to do so. Advertisers receive a record of the total number of impressions and clicks for each advert. They do not receive any personal data. If you click on an advert, we may send a referring URL to the advertiser’s website identifying that a customer is visiting from the website. We do not send personal data to advertisers with the referring URL. Once you are on the advertiser’s website, however, the advertiser is able to collect your personal data.</p>

                        <p>We do not share personal data with any third parties as we do not have a payment gateway, and our services are focused on connecting buyers and sellers.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Regulators</h3>
                        <p>We may disclose your personal data as required by law or governmental audit.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Law Enforcement</h3>
                        <p>We may disclose personal data if required:</p>

                          <li>to comply with any law;</li>
                          <li>to protect the safety of any individual or the general public; and</li>
                          <li>to prevent the violation of our customer relationship terms.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>No Selling</h3>
                        <p>We will not sell personal data. No personal data will be disclosed to anyone except as provided in this privacy policy.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Marketing Purposes</h3>
                        <p>We may disclose aggregate statistics (information about the customer population in general terms) about the personal data to advertisers or business partners.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Employees</h3>
                        <p>We do not have employees who handle personal data as part of our services, as we primarily act as a platform connecting buyers and sellers. If in the future we have employees handling personal data, we will ensure they adhere to strict non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Change of Ownership</h3>
                        <p>If we undergo a change in ownership or a merger with, acquisition by, or sale of assets to another entity, we will assign our rights to the personal data we process to a successor, purchaser, or separate entity. We will disclose the transfer on the website. If you are concerned about your personal data migrating to a new owner, you may request us to delete your personal data.</p>
